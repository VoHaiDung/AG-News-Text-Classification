# AG News Text Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project addresses the task of multi-class text classification using the AG News dataset, which comprises news articles labeled across four categories: World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology. The objective is to develop and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models capable of accurately classifying news content based on textual features.

The project follows a standard NLP pipeline, including data preprocessing (tokenization, normalization), feature representation (TF-IDF, word embeddings), and supervised model training. Multiple approaches are explored and compared, ranging from classical algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to advanced architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and fine-tuned Transformer-based models (BERT).

Performance is assessed using standard metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with emphasis on model generalization and practical deployment. The project serves as both a technical exercise and a foundational case study in text classification, providing insight into the challenges and design considerations of real-world NLP applications.

All implementation is conducted using widely adopted libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and Hugging Face Transformers, with reproducible experiments and modular code structure. This makes the project an ideal entry-level portfolio item for showcasing skills in applied natural language processing.
